THE ISSUES:
SPOF: This is the Single Point of Failure. The infrastructure here is running on a single server. So if the server fails, the website as a whole crashes.

DOWNTIME: When there is a need to check the performance and maintenance of the server, the server will need to be restatred and as a result, the downtime of the website occurs.

If there is an incoming traffic on one server, the website crashes. this is because the infrastructure can onbly handle a constricted amount of traffic.
